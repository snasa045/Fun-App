# Fun-App
[RSVP app](https://snasa045.github.io/JavaScript_Fun-App/) for tracking invitees.      

Built this aap for a JavaScript practice and to show some skills. We can consider this app as a prototype of a invitation tracking app. 
Used JavaScript techniques such as selection of elements, traversing DOM, Event objects to make this Fun-App. 
Fun-App is not sending any data or requests to server. Many improvements needed to make it fully functional.

Thank you!!!
